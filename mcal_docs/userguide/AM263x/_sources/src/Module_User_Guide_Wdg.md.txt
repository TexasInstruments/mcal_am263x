### Introduction

This document describes the functionality and configuration of the
AUTOSAR BSW module Wdg.

|Supported AUTOSAR Release|**4.3.1**|

|**Supported Configuration Variants**  | **Pre-Compile, Post-build & Link-Time**|
|**Vendor ID**                         | **WDG_VENDOR_ID (44)**|

The WDG driver depends on some other modules, like DET for error handling, OSEK/AUTOSAR OS for interrupt handling and the Mcu module for system clock settings.

### Functional Overview

#### WDG Driver Architecture

The Wdg driver has architecture as shown in below figure from the AUTOSAR spec

```{figure} Assets/images/wdg/Wdg_image1.png

:align: center

```

The WDG driver provides services for handling the watch dog timer on the microcontroller.

The WDG driver performs two main tasks, which are as follows:

1. Initialization of WDG
2. Reset WDG expiration time (trigger)

#### Initialization

The initialization covers the following steps

1. Set selected watchdog timer expiration time
2. Set selected trigger timeout
3. Set selected window size (Digital Windowed Watchdog)
4. Set selected mode (Fast or slow can be selected and can be switched runtime)

#### States

1. *WDG_IDLE*: This is indicating the module is initialized and not busy.

2. *WDG_BUSY*: This is indicating the module is busy.

#### Assumptions


1. The clock and PLL configuration is outside driver and should be configured for proper WDG operation.
2. The Pin Muxing should be initialized before initializing the Wdg module.


#### Limitations

1. Wdg_SetTriggerCondition(0): If "0" is passed as the parameter for Wdg_SetTriggerCondition will result in an immediate stop of the watchdog triggering and an instantaneous watchdog reset of the ECU (irrespective of whether reaction is NMI or reset).

#### Design overview

#### Scheduling

The Wdg module has no scheduled functions.

#### Error handling

##### Development Error Reporting (DET)

The errors reported to DET and DEM are described in the following table

|Type of Error|Related Error code|Value (Hex)|
|----|-------|-----|
|API service used in wrong context (e.g. module not initialized).|WDG_E_DRIVER_STATE|0x10|
|API service called with wrong / inconsistent parameter(s)|WDG_E_PARAM_MODE|0x11|
|API service called with wrong / inconsistent parameter(s)|WDG_E_PARAM_CONFIG|0x12|
|The passed timeout value is higher than the max timeout value.|WDG_E_PARAM_TIMEOUT|0x13|
|API is called with wrong pointer value (e.g. NULL pointer)|WDG_E_PARAM_POINTER|0x14|

##### Parameter Checking

AUTOSAR requires that API functions check the validity of their
parameters. The checks are described in spec and are done as internal
parameter checks of the API functions. These checks are for
development error reporting and can be en/dis-abled separately. Refer
to the configuration chapter where the en/dis-abling of the checks is
described. En/dis-abling of single checks is an addition to the
AUTOSAR standard which requires to en/dis-able the complete parameter
checking via the parameter WDG_DEV_ERROR_DETECT. The following table
shows which parameter checks are performed on which services:

| Services  | Wdg_Init  | Wdg_SetMode | Wdg_SetTriggerCondition | Wdg_GetVersionInfo  | Wdg_Trigger |
|--------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| WDG_E_DRIVER_STATE |           |      X      |                 |                     |       X     |
| WDG_E_PARAM_MODE     |      |      X      |                  |               |             |
| WDG_E_PARAM_CONFIG    |       |             |                 |           |        |
| WDG_E_PARAM_TIMEOUT   |       |             |           X             |                     |             |
| WDG_E_PARAM_POINTER   |       X   |       |                         |         X           |             |
| WDG_E_MODE_FAILED     |       X   |             |             |                     |             |
| WDG_E_DISABLE_REJECTED  |       X   |             |        |               |             |

##### Production Code Error Reporting

By default, production code related errors are reported to the DEM using the service DEM_ReportErrorStatus().
The errors reported to DEM are described in the following table:

|Type of Error|Related Error code|Description|
|----|-------|-----|
|Assigned by DEM|WDG_E_MODE_FAILED|This error is raised when setting the watchdog mode fails.|
|Assigned by DEM|WDG_E_DISABLE_REJECTED|Initialization or watchdog mode switch failed because it would disable the watchdog though this is not allowed in this configuration |
|Assigned by DEM|WDG_E_HARDWARE_ERROR|This error is raised when register write failure occurs (Hardware Failure) |

### Used resources

#### Interrupt Handling

Watchdog uses Non maskable interrupt (Interrupt Number 128) and the ISR shall be called when interrupt occurs

| Interrupt Number| ISR API Mapped  |
|----------------|----------------|
| RTI_WDT0_NMI | WDT_Isr |

### Integration description

#### Dependent modules

##### MCU

The module MCU powers up the microcontroller’s peripherals at startup time and initializes the PLL.

##### OS

An operating system can be used for task scheduling, interrupt handling, global suspend and restore of
interrupts and creating of the Interrupt Vector Table. The WDG module may use AUTOSAR OS to suspend and
restore global interrupts.

##### SchM

There are no exclusive areas.

##### Critical Sections

There are no critical sections.

##### DEM

By default, production code related errors are reported to the DEM using the service DEM_ReportErrorStatus().
**Note:** Dem Event is enable only if `$(Module_Name)DemEventParameterRefs` is enabled.

##### DET

By  default,  production  code  related  errors  are  reported  to  the  DET  using  the  service
Det_ReportError().
If development error reporting is enabled (i.e. pre-compile parameter WDG_DEV_ERROR_DETECT== STD_ON).
The reported service IDs identify the services which are described in 3.4.

##### Callback Notification

The WDG driver does not provide any call back functions.

#### Multi-core support

Not supported

### Examples

#### Overview

1. Initializes clock using Mcu_Init()
2. Configure the interrupts for WDG using WDTApp_interruptConfig()
3. Default Example program is configured in Non-Maskable Interrupt method (WDT will trigger interrupt when counter becomes zero).
4. WDT window reaction can be changed to "reset" through configuration (EB Tresos).
5. Get Watchdog version using Wdg_GetVersionInfo()
6. Calculate and define the triggerValue and maxServiceInterval
7. In example, service interval is 6ms and service count is 25. So, every 6ms core will service the WDT for 25 times (25*6 = 150 ms).
8. Initialize the timer using Gpt_Init()
9. Initialize the Watchdog using Wdg_Init()
10. Start the timer using API Gpt_StartTimer()
11. Set the trigger condition using Wdg_SetTriggerCondition() along with timeout value (Timeout is defined by subtracting triggerValue with maxServiceInterval)
12. Then after it will raise an interrupt and interrupt will run (WDT_Isr() function). In ISR function core reset will occurs and start running program again automatically.
13. On reset, Check the reason for the reset using GetResetReason(). If reset happened due to WDT then "Test Passed"
14. In Reset window reaction mode, after counter reaches to zero POR(Power ON Reset) happens.

#### Hardware Software Setup and Tools

None

#### Steps to build and run example


1. WDG example application demonstrates the MCAL WDG driver features, which is referred from folder <MCAL_ROOT>/examples/WDG.
2. This application can be built from the build folder by giving "gmake –s wdg_app PLATFORM=am263" command in command prompt.
3. Once the build is completed we get an appimage file, which is flashed in am263x controller and executed.
4. To Flash the appimage at the respective memory location as the SBL expects, path of the appimage file is provided in "default_sbl_qspi" file in "..\<MCU_PLUS_SDK_INSTALLATION>\tools\boot\sbl_prebuilt\am263x-cc"
5. Set the boot mode of board to UART mode.(UART boot mode: 1000)
6. Open command prompt at the path "..\<MCU_PLUS_SDK_INSTALLATION>\tools\boot\" and provide command as follows: "python uart_uniflash.py -p COM\<x> --cfg=sbl_prebuilt/am263x-cc/default_sbl_qspi.cfg" Here \<x> depicts the COM PORT number where hardware is connected to system, which can be detected from device manager
7. Once the appimage is flashed after the command is executed, change the boot mode of board to QSPI mode.(QSPI boot mode: 0010)
8. Open the terminal to get the expected application log after doing hard reset on board.
9. Verify that the application produces the correct results as expected shown below.
