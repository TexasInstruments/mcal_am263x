### Functional Overview

The ADC module initiates analog to digital conversion requests and provides the conversion results for external analog monitoring channels and internally connected digital temperature sensors. It provides services to start, stop and read conversion results for configurable ADC groups consisting of one or more external analog monitoring channels.

#### ADC Driver Architecture

The following figure shows where the ADC is located in the AUTOSAR
architecture

The ADC hardware module is a successive approximation (SAR) style ADC. This ADC is composed of a core and a wrapper. The core is composed of the analog circuits which include the channel select MUX, the sample-and hold (S/H) circuit, the successive approximation circuits, voltage reference circuits, and other analog support circuits. The wrapper is composed of the digital circuits that configure and control the ADC. These circuits include the logic for programmable conversions, result registers, interfaces to analog circuits, interfaces to the peripheral buses, post-processing circuits, and interfaces to other on-chip modules. Each ADC module consists of a single sample-and-hold (S/H) circuit. The ADC module is designed to be duplicated multiple times on the same chip, allowing simultaneous sampling or independent operation of multiple ADCs.

#### Initialization

Adc_Init() has to be called to initialize the ADC driver before initiating any group conversion.
This will also set all the groups to ADC_IDLE state.

#### States

There are 4 states in which each ADC group for one shot single access
mode can be:

1. *ADC_IDLE*: This is the state before starting a group, no conversion request for the group has been initiated or after the conversion result of a stream completed group is read.

2. *ADC_BUSY*: This is the state after a group is started but hasn’t finished i.e. conversion result for the group is not yet available.

3. *ADC_COMPLETED*: This is the state after a group has finished first or more samples of ADC analog input.

4. *ADC_STREAM_COMPLETED*: This is the state after a group has finished i.e., conversion result for the group is available.

```

#### Assumptions

Below listed are assumed to valid for this design/implementation, exceptions and other deviations are listed for each explicitly. Care should be taken to ensure these assumptions are addressed.

1. ADC module requires system clock to be in operation.
2. ADC module is not dependent on PORT module for Configuration of ADC Port pins.
3. Configuration of ADC cross bar interrupts shall be configured in MCU module.
4. ADC data buffer control for each hardware unit is handled by MCU module.
5. For using DMA feature, driver assumes that cache initialization is done in application only and not done by the driver.

#### Limitations

**Maximum 4 hardware triggered channel groups can be queued, when ADC Priority implementation ADC_PRIORITY_HW and ADC_PRIORITY_HW_SW.**

```{Note}
Hardware Triggered Channel Groups can be queued with ADC Priority implementation **ADC_PRIORITY_HW** and **ADC_PRIORITY_HW_SW**.
   
ADC Priority implementation **ADC_PRIORITY_HW** and **ADC_PRIORITY_HW_SW** requires all four Interrupts (ADC_INT1 to ADC_INT4) for conversion of ADC (In case of using queuing mechanism).

```

#### Design overview

##### ADC Hardware Description

ADC module is composed of

1. Five Hardware units,

2. Each Hardware unit has four ADC interrupt

3. Each Hardware unit has Analog input channels ADCIN[0:5] ( have dedicated pins ).

4. Each Hardware unit has 15 SOC's (start of conversion units) for conversion of ADC channels.

```{figure} Assets/images/adc/adc_image15.png
:alt: SOC architecture
:align: center

SOC architecture
```

The analog channel which needs to be converted, needs to be placed in one of the SOC's for conversion and result will be available is respective result register as shown in below figure.
Based on trigger (either HW trigger or SW trigger), conversion shall be started for ADC HW Channel.

```{figure} Assets/images/adc/adc_image14.png
:alt: ADC Channel Conversion Process
:align: center

ADC Channel Conversion Process
```

##### Autosar ADC Design

The ADC Analog input channels are configured in container *AdcChannel*. The actual physical channel ID needs to be specified here.

The ADC Group consists of the combination of ADC channels. These Groups configured in container *AdcHwUnit*.

The below figure shows, how physical channels are mapped in Group.

```{figure} Assets/images/adc/adc_image16.png
:alt: ADC Channel Group Configuration
:align: center

ADC Channel Group Configuration
```

Since the conversion of ADC Channels is based on ADC Group in AUTOSAR, the ADC Groups are placed in SOC's based on Group's being called for conversion using autosar API's:

*Adc_StartGroupConversion* for SW triggered groups

*Adc_EnableHardwareTrigger* for HW triggered groups

The below figure shows the group conversion process for AUTOSAR ADC module in ADC hardware:

```{figure} Assets/images/adc/adc_image17.png
:alt: ADC Channel Group Conversion Process
:align: center

ADC Channel Group Conversion Process
```

Here based on group priority the ADC Groups are allocated with SOC's of Hardware unit. Lowest priority group will be at bottom of SOC and highest will be at TOP of SOC structure.
If high priority group comes during execution of low priority group, the high priority Group shall be placed above the top of low priority SOC.
If the priority mechanism is active, the ADC module shall handle channel group conversion requests for groups with the same priority level, in a ‘first come first served’ order.

##### Cross Bar Interrupt

There are four interrupts for each hardware unit of ADC module, which can be access through cross bar interrupt.
There are 32 cross bar interrupts for AM263x, ADC modules can be mapped to any of these cross interrupts as per requirement.


The Mapping of ADC interrupts and cross bar interrupts are handled by MCU module configuration. (Refer section : [MCU](#mcu))

Same interrupt source number should be configured by application.

```{figure} Assets/images/adc/adc_image18.png
:alt: Interrupt Cross Bar List
:align: center

Interrupt Cross Bar List
```

##### ADC Polling Mechanism

In Polling Mechanism, we shall use the API *Adc_PollingMainFunction*.
This API shall be responsible to change the group status and updated the group channelbuffer(which are configured as polling mode).
The Function "Adc_PollingMainFunction", shall be called periodically or else via using API "Adc_GetStatus".

The consistency of the group channel results can be obtained via API function *Adc_GetGroupStatus* and *Adc_ReadGroup*.

```{Note}
   Cross bar Interrupts for ADC interrupt shall be configured in MCU module.
   
   If priority mechanism is ADC_PRIORITY_NONE, only SW triggered groups can be configured and SW groups are stored in SW Queue as per priority.
   
   Multiple HW trigger Group can be stored in SOC's (Depending on channels configured in Group), if priority mechanism ADC_PRIORITY_HW_SW or ADC_PRIORITY_HW.
   
   SW trigger Group are stored in SW Queue and HW triggered Group's are allocated with SOC's ( if group priority is higher then current executing group ).
   
   Its recommended to disable all the ADC interrupts related of particular Hardware unit in the application, if ADC groups are configured in Polling mode.
   
   In case of mixed mode setting is used (Polling and Interrupt mode together) then the conversion should be triggered one after the other.
```

AUTOSAR requires that API functions check the validity of their parameters. The checks are described in spec and are done as internal parameter checks of the API functions. These checks are for development error reporting and can be en/dis-abled separately. Refer to the configuration chapter where the en/dis-abling of the checks is described. En/dis-abling of single checks is an addition to the AUTOSAR standard which requires to en/dis-able the complete parameter checking via the parameter ADC_DEV_ERROR_DETECT. The following table shows which parameter checks are performed on which services:

### Integration description

#### Dependent modules

##### MCU

The ADC modules expects the MCU module to be powered on.
The ADC module depends on MCU module for data buffer control and crossbar interrupt mapping
of ADC interrupts depending on the Hardware unit being configured.

Suppose the Hardware Unit 1 and Hardware Unit 3 are configured for ADC module:

```{figure} Assets/images/adc/adc_image6.jpeg
:alt: ADC Hardware container
:align: center

ADC Hardware container
```

Then, the MCU module container **McuAdcConfiguration** should be configured as shown in below figure:

```{figure} Assets/images/adc/adc_image7.jpeg
:alt: McuAdcConfiguration container
:align: center

McuAdcConfiguration container
```

```{figure} Assets/images/adc/adc_image8.jpeg
:alt: McuAdcConfiguration container
:alt: ADC Hardware unit selection
:align: center

ADC Hardware unit selection
```

Similarly, the crossbar interrupts also needs to be mapped in MCU module according to HW unit and
interrupts being required.

The ADC interrupts needs to be mapped to the corresponding cross bar interrupt required.

Please refer limitation section of Interrupts to be configured for ADC as per **AdcPriorityImplementation**.

```

##### DMA

The ADC Module requires DMA module to be configured, when ADC is configured in DMA
mode and ADC channel Group is configured for DMA access.

1. ADC Module Configuration:

   * The ADC module parameter **AdcDMAEnable** should be configured for **TRUE**.

   * The ADC Channel Group parameter **AdcGroupDataAccessMethod** should be configured with **ADC_GROUP_DMA_ACCESS**.

   * The ADC parameter **AdcDmaChannelId** in **AdcChannel** container represents the DMA Channel ID (0 to 63) to be configured.

   * This **AdcDmaChannelId** parameter should be configured sequentially.

2. DMA module Configuration:

   * In CDD DMA module, **CddDmaChannelTriggerConfiguration** container should be configured w.r.t the trigger selection for ADC module.

   * ADC module is dependent on X-BAR DMA interrupts, thus we have configure the X-BAR interrupts in DMA module.

3. The ADC Trigger source should be configured for one and many of DMA channels using following parameters, in containers

   * **CddDmaDmaChannelModule** represents the DMA Channel ID (0 - 63)
   * **CddDmaChannelTriggerSource** represents which Trigger source we should map the DMA Channel ID.
   * **CddDmaDmaChannelXbar** represents the DMA Cross-BAR. If the **CddDmaChannelTriggerSource** is selected between **DMA_TRIG_XBAR_DMA_XBAR_OUT_0** to **DMA_TRIG_XBAR_DMA_XBAR_OUT_15**, then this parameter should be mapped to respective Cross-BAR.
   * **CddDmaDmaChannelXbarMap** represents the trigger source for the Cross-BAR, which can be from module like ADC, EPWM, FSI etc.
   * The ADC Trigger source should be selected according to the Interrupt Source and ADC instance configured. The ADC parameter **AdcDmaChannelId** in **AdcChannel** container and **CddDmaDmaChannelModule** in **CddDmaChannelTriggerConfiguration** container should be same.

##### DET

This implementation depends on the DET in order to report development errors The detection of development errors is configurable (ON / OFF).

##### SchM

If multiple AUTOSAR runnables have access to the same Data Store Memory block, the exported AUTOSAR specification enforces data consistency by using an AUTOSAR exclusive area. With this specification, the runnables have mutually exclusive access to the per-instance memory global data, which prevents data corruption. Beside the OS, the BSW Scheduler provides functions that ADC module calls at begin and end of critical sections. This implementation requires 1 level of exclusive access to guard critical sections.

The data consistency mechanism that has to be applied to an ExclusiveArea might be domain, ECU or even project specific. The decision which mechanism has to be applied by RTE / Basic Software Scheduler is taken during ECU integration by setting the Exclusive Area configuration parameter **RteExclusiveAreaImplMechanism**. This parameter is an input for RTE generator.

For ADC Module, data consistency and exclusive access to critical sections are required for the following sections as shown in the table below:

| Exclusive Area Functions used | ADC Function calling Exclusive Area | Need for Exclusive Area | Recommended Exclusive Area Mapping |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|ADC_EXCLUSIVE_AREA_0 | Adc_DeInit<br>Adc_SetupResultBuffer<br>Adc_GetGroupStatus<br>Adc_GetStreamLastPointer<br>Adc_StartGroupConversion<br>Adc_StopGroupConversion<br>Adc_ReadGroup<br>Adc_EnableGroupNotification<br>Adc_DisableGroupNotification<br>Adc_EnableHardwareTrigger<br>Adc_DisableHardwareTrigger<br>Adc_PollingMainFunction | To protect against multiple access for shared resources|**ALL_INTERRUPT_BLOCKING** : All interrupts should be blocked as this API's can be called in the interrupts |

##### Callback Functions

The ADC driver does not provide any call back functions

##### Callback Notification

**Notifications:**

As it is a configurable interface, the ADC defines notifications that can be mapped to callback functions provided by other modules. The mapping is not statically defined by the ADC but can be performed at configuration time. The function prototypes that can be used for the configuration have to match the appropriate function prototype signatures, which are described in the following.

**Adc_GroupEndNotifyType:**

This is of type Adc_GroupEndNotifyType which is defined in Adc_Types.h file. This is called to notify the group about the completion of the requested conversion and availability of the conversion results.

#### Multi-core support

Not Supported

### Configuration

##### AdcPowerStateConfig
Each instance of this parameter defines a power state and the callback to be called when this power state is reached.
### Examples

#### Overview

* Adc Example:
  * Initialize clock using Mcu_Init()
  * Apply different voltages (between 0 - 3.3 volts) to the six ADC channels
  * Initialize Adc using Adc_Init()
  * Configure Adc interrupt using AdcApp_interruptConfig() after init to avoid interrupts at start-up.
  * Get Adc Version using Adc_GetVersionInfo()
  * Enable notification using Adc_EnableGroupNotification()
  * Start ADC conversion using Adc_StartGroupConversion()
  * Read and store the result using Adc_ReadGroup()
  * Wait for all group conversion to get over
  * Disable notification using Adc_DisableGroupNotification()
  * Deinitialize ADC using Adc_DeInit()

#### Setup required to run example

ADC module is tested using CC board (PROC111E2) and analog input is provided to ADC
input channels through DC power supply (0-12V).

The ADC analog input for the AM263x ranges from 0 – 3.3V.


ADC_ANI0 is provided with 1V.

ADC_ANI1 is provided with 3.2V.


#### How to run examples

##### Steps to build and run example

ADC example application demonstrating the MCAL ADC driver features is in folder *<MCAL_ROOT>/examples/Adc*.

This application can be built from the root folder by giving *gmake –s adc_app PLATFORM=am263*.


Once the build is completed we get a binary file, which is loaded in our controller and executed.

##### Configuration used to test this example

The ADC module example is configured with following groups on ADC Hardware Unit 1

1. Adc Group 0 : One Shot Conversion Software Triggered with Data Access Polling Mode.
2. Adc Group 1 : One Shot Conversion Software Triggered with Data Access Interrupt Mode.
3. Adc Group 2 : One Shot Conversion Software Triggered with Data Access Polling Mode.
4. Adc Group 3 : One Shot Conversion Software Triggered with Data Access Interrupt Mode.

The ADC module example application testing procedure as follows:

HW UNIT 1 is configured

One Shot Mode Testing: (Group 0) (Group 1) (Group 2) (Group 3) (HW UNIT 1)

1. Group is Triggered for Conversion using API Adc_StartConversion()
2. Adc_PollingMainFunction() is called for Groups configured as Data Access Polling Mode.
3. AdcApp_procIsr() is called through AdcApp_GroupEndNotification for Groups configured as Data Access Interrupt Mode.
4. Wait until the conversion is completed.
5. Conversion is stopped using API Adc_StopConversion().
6. Check the notification message, the notification counter should be incremented with ADC results available in the ADC result buffer ( Adc_AppBuffer )

Cross bar mapping:

1. ADC HW UNIT 1 : ADC1.INT1 is mapped to XBAR1 (147)
2. ADC HW UNIT 3 : ADC3.INT1 is mapped to XBAR2 (148)

Refer crossbar section in MCU module to map crossbar.

#### ADC with DMA example

* adc hardware trigger dma example:

1. This example application is to use a hardware trigger like EPWM to trigger ADC start of conversion and copy the result using dma to the specified buffer
2. Initialize Cdd Pwm, Dma and Adc along with interrupt configuration
3. Setup the result buffer for ADC results for the configured adc groups
4. As we are using epwm as the trigger, enable the ADC hardware trigger using API Adc_EnableHardwareTrigger
5. Enable Continue to Interrupt mode using Adc_SetInterruptContinuousMode
6. Configure the DMA in the application with source and destination buffers
7. Configure epwm channel and start the time base counter
8. Print the result with the dma copied buffer and disable the hardware trigger for the adc groups
9. Disable the epwm trigger and verify the test status

##### Configuration used

* The configuration is available in the examples folder in the following file path
 **<MCAL_ROOT>/examples/Adc/adc_hw_trig_dma_app/soc**

* One key point to note here is adc group access mode is configured as "POLLING" so that in application, the Continue to Interrupt mode is enabled and dma copies the data from result registers to destination buffer continuously until stopped in the application.

##### Steps to build and run adc_hw_trig_dma_app example

adc_hw_trig_dma_app example is located in folder *<MCAL_ROOT>/examples/Adc*.

This application can be built from the root folder by giving *gmake –s adc_hw_trig_dma_app PLATFORM=am263*.
