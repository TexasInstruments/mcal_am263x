### Functional Overview

The Fast Serial Interface (FSI) module is a serial communication peripheral capable of reliable high-speed communication across isolation devices. The FSI is designed specifically to ensure reliable high-speed communication for system scenarios that involve communication across isolation barriers without adding components. The FSI consists of independent transmitter
(CDD FSI TX) and receiver (CDD FSI RX) cores. The CDD FSITX and CDD FSIRX cores are configured and operated independently. Both CDD FSI TX and FsiRx are capable of configurable frame length and can be operated via DMA. The following figure shows where the CDD Module is located in the AUTOSAR architecture. Since CDD FSI Transmitter and Receiver are CDD Module it occupies the highlighted region in the AUTOSAR architecture.

#### Functional Overview of CDD FSI Receiver

The receiver module interfaces to the CDD FSI Receiver clock (RXCLK), and data lines (RXD0 and RXD1). The receiver core handles the data framing, CRC computation,and frame-related error checking. The receiver bit clock and state machine are run by the RXCLK input,
which is asynchronous to the device system clock. The receiver control registers allow the CPU to program, control, and monitor the operation of the FSI receiver.The receive data buffer is accessible by the CPU and the DMA.

#### Initialization

Cdd_FsiRx_Init() has to be called to initialize the Fsi Receiver driver before initiating a reception.This will also set  the CDD FSI Receiver Hardware Unit to CDD_FSI_RX_IDLE STATE.

#### States

There are 2 states in which each CDD FSI Receiver HW Unit can be:

1. *CDD_FSI_RX_UNINIT*: This is the state before the CDD FSI Receiver is initialized.
2. *CDD_FSI_RX_IDLE*: This is the state before starting a reception. The receiver becomes idle only after it gets initialized.

#### Assumptions

None

#### Limitations

1. **RXCLK  should be connected to TXCLK and it should never be configured to be faster than SYSCLK/2.**

2. **Data Frame Configuration of Receiver Module should be in sync with the transmitter. (frame type, data width ).**

3. **In FSI, as soon as the DMA  trigger is started, whatever data is available in the internal FSI buffer is transferred immediately before the DMA actually transfers from external buffer to FSI internal buffer. As a workaround, we are manually copying onto internal buffer before FSI DMA event is enabled**

This feature can be used to check the physical connection between Tx and Rx).
2. User Configurable Frame Watch Dog Timeout value(If the Rx instance does not receive a data frame within the configured timeout period of Frame WatchDog, then the Watchdog will Timeout and sent notification to application. This feature can be used to check the physical connection between Tx and Rx).

#### Configurable Reception Modes

The FSI Receiver can Receive data in three different Modes.

1. Interrupt Mode.
2. Polling Mode.
3. DMA Mode.

##### Interrupt Mode

Each FSI module contains multiple interrupt sources which can be assigned to two different interrupt vectors: INT1 and INT2. Each interrupt source has an associated status flag. In Interrupt Mode, the parameter **CddFsiRxMainApi** and  should be OFF and **CddFsiRxDMAEnable**
in Cdd_FsiRx_Cfg.h will be OFF. The receiver can generate the following interrupts:

1. Ping Watchdog Timeout (PING_WD_TO) : This event indicates that the ping watchdog timer has timed out. The receiver has not received a valid frame within the time period specified in the RX_PING_WD_REF register. To enable this Interrupt Event,  the parameter **CddFsiRxPingWdgTimeoutInterruptEvent** in Cdd_FsiRx_Cfg.h should be ON.
2. Frame Watchdog Timeout (FRAME_WD_TO) : This event indicates that the frame watchdog timer has timed out. The conditions of this timeout are set using the RX_FRAME_WD_CTRL register.    As soon as the start of frame phase is detected, the frame watchdog counter will start counting from 0. The end of frame phase must complete by the time the watchdog counter    reaches the reference value. If this does not happen, the watchdog will time out and this event will be generated. If this event occurs, the receiver must undergo a soft reset and subsequent resynchronization in order to guarantee proper operation. The Parameter **CddFsiRxFrameWdgTimeoutInterruptEvent** in Cdd_FsiRx_Cfg.h
3. Ping Frame Received (PING_FRAME)  : This event indicates that a ping frame has been received. The Parameter **CddFsiRxPingFrameReceivedInterruptEvent** in Cdd_FsiRx_Cfg.h should be ON.
4. Data Frame Received (DATA_FRAME)  : This event indicates that a data frame has been received. The macro **CddFsiRxDataFrameReceivedInterruptEvent** in Cdd_FsiRx_Cfg.h should be ON.

##### Polling Mode

In Polling Mode the FSI Receiver  is continuously polled using **Cdd_FsiRx_MainFunction** API to check whether data has received or not. In Polling Mode the states of different macros inside Cdd_FsiTx_Cfg.h are listed below:

1. CDD_FSI_RX_MAIN_FUNCTION_API           -STD ON.
2. CDD_FSI_RX_DMA_ENABLE                  -STD OFF
3. CDD_FSI_RX_PING_WDG_TIMEOUT_INTERRUPT  -STD OFF
4. CDD_FSI_RX_FRAME_WDG_TIMEOUT_INTERRUPT -STD OFF
5. CDD_FSI_RX_CRC_ERROR_INTERRUPT         -STD OFF
6. CDD_FSI_RX_BUFFER_OVERRUN_INTERRUPT    -STD OFF
7. CDD_FSI_RX_BUFFER_UNDERRUN_INTERRUPT   -STD OFF
8. CDD_FSI_RX_PING_RECEIVED_INTERRUPT     -STD OFF
9. CDD_FSI_RX_DATA_RECEIVED_INTERRUPT    -STD OFF
10. **The Parameter related with each Interrupt event should be OFF if Main Function API Parameter is ON.**

##### DMA Mode

The FSI Receiver can receive data which is continuously copied to the destination buffer with the DMA. In order to transmit continuous data with the DMA, some configurations need to be made on the transmitter:

1. Configure the DMA channel and handle for the Rx Instance in CDD_DMA_TRANSFER_MODE_CHAINING
2. Whenever data receives at the Rx internal buffer , the Rx interrupt will get hit and it will trigger internal function to copy data from Internal buffer to destination buffer.

In DMA Mode the states of different macros inside Cdd_FsiRx_Cfg.h are listed below:

1. CDD_FSI_RX_MAIN_FUNCTION_API           -STD OFF
2. CDD_FSI_RX_DMA_ENABLE                  -STD ON
3. CDD_FSI_RX_PING_WDG_TIMEOUT_INTERRUPT  -STD OFF
4. CDD_FSI_RX_FRAME_WDG_TIMEOUT_INTERRUPT -STD OFF
5. CDD_FSI_RX_CRC_ERROR_INTERRUPT         -STD OFF
6. CDD_FSI_RX_BUFFER_OVERRUN_INTERRUPT    -STD OFF
7. CDD_FSI_RX_BUFFER_UNDERRUN_INTERRUPT   -STD OFF
8. CDD_FSI_RX_PING_RECEIVED_INTERRUPT     -STD OFF
9. CDD_FSI_RX_DATA_RECEIVED_INTERRUPT    -STD OFF

#### Interrupt Handling

For interrupt notification, ISR's are provided in CDD FSI RX driver. There are two ISRs for each CDD FSI RX hardware units. Depending on hardware unit configured, it will call the notify function. The interrupt service routines shall be mapped to the interrupt sources of the respective cross bar interrupt. The supported ISRs are part of the CddFsiRx_Irq.h file. Following are the ISRs for each CDD FSI RX hardware units:

### Integration description

#### The CDD FSI RX Driver dependent modules

##### MCU

The CDD FSI RX  modules expects the MCU module to be powered on. The CDD FSI RX module depends on MCU module for  crossbar interrupt mapping of CDD FSI RX interrupts depending on the Hardware unit being configured.
Suppose the Hardware Unit 1 is configured for CDD FSI RX module:

```{figure} Assets/images/fsi/fsirx_image6.png
:alt: CDD FSI RX Hardware container
:align: center

CDD FSI RX Hardware container
```

Similarly, the crossbar interrupts also needs to be mapped in MCU module according to HW unit and interrupts being required. The FSI Rx interrupts needs to be mapped to the corresponding cross bar interrupt required. For each CDD FSI RX instance there will be two interrupt vectors. INT1 and INT2. For each interrupt vector separate Crossbar pins should be selected in mcu configuration.

##### DMA

The CDD FSI RX Modules requires DMA module to be configured, when CDD FSI RX reception is configured in DMA
mode.

1.CDD FSI RX Module Configuration:

* The CDD FSI RX module parameter **CddFsiRxDMAEnable** should be configured for **TRUE**.
* The CDD FSI RX HW Unit parameter **CddFsiRxReceptionMethod** should be configured with **CDD_FSI_RX_DMA_MODE**.
* The DMA supports CDD FSI TX in interrupt mode only.
* The reception mode in configurator should be **CDD_FSI_RX_DMA_MODE** and interrupt should be enabled inside the code.

2.DMA module Configuration:

* Set up two DMA channels to be triggered by the same CDD FSI receiver and DMA trigger.
* Configure one channel to take data from the Rx buffer.
* Configure the other channel to copy the frame tag and user data fields.
* Configure the DMA handleId and other parameters for each CDD FSI RX instance inside DMA configurator.
* The DMA Configuration reference has given inside CDD FSI RX configurator to select the handleId for each RX Instance.

```

##### DET

This implementation depends on the DET in order to report development errors. The detection of development errors is configurable (ON / OFF).

##### DEM

By  default,  production  code  related  errors  are  reported  to  the  DEM  using  the  service DEM_ReportErrorStatus().

```{Note}
 Dem Event is enable only if `$(Module_Name)DemEventParameterRefs` is enabled.

```

##### SchM

If multiple AUTOSAR runnables have access to the same Data Store Memory block, the exported AUTOSAR specification enforces data consistency by using an AUTOSAR exclusive area. With this specification, the runnables have mutually exclusive access to the per-instance memory global data, which prevents data corruption. Beside the OS, the BSW Scheduler provides functions that CDD FSI RX module calls at begin and end of critical sections. This implementation requires 1 level of exclusive access to guard critical sections.

The data consistency mechanism that has to be applied to an ExclusiveArea might be domain, ECU or even project specific. The decision which mechanism has to be applied by RTE / Basic Software Scheduler is taken during ECU integration by setting the Exclusive Area configuration parameter RteExclusiveAreaImplMechanism. This parameter is an input for RTE generator.

For CDD_FSI_RX Module, data consistency and exclusive access to critical sections are required for the following sections as shown in the table below:

| Exclusive Area Functions used | CDD_FSI_RX Function calling Exclusive Area | Need for Exclusive Area | Recommended Exclusive Area Mapping |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|FSI_RX_EXCLUSIVE_AREA_0 | Cdd_FsiRx_MainFunction<br>Cdd_FsiRx_DmaDataReceive<br>Cdd_FsiRx_setUpBuffer | To protect against multiple access for shared resources|**ALL_INTERRUPT_BLOCKING** : All interrupts should be blocked as this API's can be called in the interrupts |

### Examples

#### Overview

The CDD FSI module example application  UT testing  is done together with CDD FSI TX and CDD FSI RX modules (loop back test) and the configurations are as follows:

FSI TX HW UNIT 1 and  FSI RX HW UNIT 1 are configured

SDR-INTERRUPT MODE-16 WORDS-SW TRIGGER: (HW UNIT 1)

1. Initialize the Transmitter and Receiver.

2. Transmit the Ping Frame with Tag 0 using API Cdd_FsiTx_Ping().

3. Load the Transmission Buffer with Data using API Cdd_FsiTx_BufferLoad().

4. Transmission and Reception are initiated using API  Cdd_FsiTx_Transmit() and Cdd_FsiTx_Receive() respectively with SW Trigger, 16 words data length, Single Data Rate(Onlt TXD0 and RXD0) and in Interrupt Mode.

5. Wait till reception completes and notification prints.

6. Once test is completed successfully, verify the data in destination Buffer.

SDR-DMA MODE-16 WORDS-SW TRIGGER: (HW UNIT 1)

1. Initialize the Transmitter and Receiver.

2. Transmit the Ping Frame with Tag 0 using API Cdd_FsiTx_Ping().
