The MCU driver provides services for basic microcontroller initialization, reset and microcontroller specific functions required by other MCAL software modules.

The MCU driver provides MCU services for Clock and RAM initialization. In the MCU configuration set, the MCU specific settings for the Clock (i.e. PLL setting) and RAM (i.e. section base address and size) shall be configured.

### Functional Overview

#### MCU Driver Architecture

The MCU driver has architecture as shown in below figure from the
AUTOSAR spec.

```

#### Initialization

Mcu_Init() initializes the MCU driver and does module enable for the
configured module ids.

To enable PLL, MCU_NO_PLL should be kept STD_OFF and generate, so that it will generate PLL configuration required in Mcu_Cfg.h and Mcu_PBcfg.c/Mcu_Cfg.c.
Refer to figure below :

```{figure} Assets/images/mcu/mcu_image6.png
```

For AM263x, configuration settings are as shown below:

1. Core_Pll shall be set for **2000MHz** and is divided into three *HSDIV* values such as:

   **DPLL_CORE_HSDIV0_CLKOUT0: 400MHz, DPLL_CORE_HSDIV0_CLKOUT1: 500MHz, DPLL_CORE_HSDIV0_CLKOUT2: 400MHz** , where **DPLL_CORE_HSDIV0_CLKOUT0(400MHz)** will be given to core.

Refer to figure below :

```{figure} Assets/images/mcu/mcu_image25.png
```

2. Per_Pll shall be set for **1920MHz** and is divided into two *HSDIV* values such as:

   **DPLL_PER_HSDIV0_CLKOUT0: 160MHz** and **DPLL_PER_HSDIV0_CLKOUT1: 192MHz**

Refer to figure below :

```{figure} Assets/images/mcu/mcu_image26.png
```

**ADC:**

MCU powers the ADC module. The ADC module depends on MCU module for data buffer control and crossbar interrupt mapping of ADC interrupts depending on the Hardware unit being configured.
Suppose the Hardware Unit 1 and Hardware Unit 3 are configured for ADC module:

```{figure} Assets/images/mcu/mcu_image7.png
```

Then, the MCU module container "McuAdcConfiguration" should be configured as shown in below figure:

```{figure} Assets/images/mcu/mcu_image8.png
```

```{figure} Assets/images/mcu/mcu_image9.png
```

**Interrupt Crossbar(ADC):**

MCU is also enabling Interrupt crossbar and Input crossbar in Mcu_Init().
Similarly, the crossbar interrupts also needs to be mapped in MCU module according to HW unit and interrupts being required.
The ADC interrupts needs to be mapped to the corresponding cross bar interrupt required. Please refer limitation section of Interrupts to be configured for ADC as per "AdcPriorityImplementation" in ADC user guide.

```{figure} Assets/images/mcu/mcu_image10.png
```

```{figure} Assets/images/mcu/mcu_image11.png
```

**PWM:**

MCU also powers the PWM module. The PWM module depends on MCU module to enable PWM Channel and crossbar interrupt mapping of PWM interrupts depending on the Hardware unit being configured.
Suppose the PWM channel 0 is configured for PWM module as shown in figure:

```{figure} Assets/images/mcu/mcu_image12.png
```

Then, the MCU module container "McuPwmConfiguration" should be configured as shown in below figure:

```{figure} Assets/images/mcu/mcu_image15.png
```

```{figure} Assets/images/mcu/mcu_image16.png
```

The interrupt cross bar generates the functions in "Mcu_IntXbar" in Mcu_PBcfg.c as per the user configuration from configurator as shown in below figure:

```{figure} Assets/images/mcu/mcu_image17.png
```


**CDD PWM:**

MCU also powers the CDD PWM module. The CDD PWM module depends on MCU module to enable CddPwm channel, required input crossbar and crossbar interrupt mapping of EPWM interrupts depending on the Hardware unit being configured.
Suppose the CDD PWM channel 0 is configured for CDD PWM module as shown in figure:

```{figure} Assets/images/mcu/mcu_image31.png
```

Then, the MCU module container "McuCddPwmConfiguration" should be configured as shown in below figure:

```{figure} Assets/images/mcu/mcu_image32.png
```

```{figure} Assets/images/mcu/mcu_image33.png
```

**Interrupt Crossbar(CDD PWM):**

The crossbar interrupts needs to be mapped in MCU module according to CDD PWM channel configured. The EPWM interrupts needs to be mapped to the corresponding cross bar interrupt.

```{figure} Assets/images/mcu/mcu_image34.png
```

```{figure} Assets/images/mcu/mcu_image35.png
```

```{figure} Assets/images/mcu/mcu_image36.png
```

The interrupt cross bar generates the functions in "Mcu_IntXbar" in Mcu_PBcfg.c as per the user configuration from configurator as shown in below figure:

```{figure} Assets/images/mcu/mcu_image37.png
```

Input Crossbar can be configured from MCU as per following figure:

```{figure} Assets/images/mcu/mcu_image18.png
```

```{figure} Assets/images/mcu/mcu_image19.png
```

As per user configuration, input crossbars APIs will be generated in Mcu_PBcfg.c as in figure.

```{figure} Assets/images/mcu/mcu_image20.png
```


**GPIO Crossbar:**

GPIO crossbars routing can be done for PORT module from MCU as per following figure:

```{figure} Assets/images/mcu/mcu_image28.png
```

```{figure} Assets/images/mcu/mcu_image29.png

|Assigned by DEM|MCU_E_HARDWARE_ERROR|This error is raised when register write failure occurs. (Hardware Failure)  |

**Note:** MCU_E_MODE_FAILURE should be always disabled. Since Mcu_SetMode is not supported, MCU_E_MODE_FAILURE should always be disabled.

### Used resources

#### Interrupt Handling

The MCU module doesn’t implement any Interrupt Service Routines.

### Integration description

#### Dependent modules

##### DET

The module MCU depends on the DET (by default) in order to report development errors.
Detection and reporting of development errors can be enabled or disabled by the switch
MCU_DEV_ERROR_DETECT = STD_ON in the Mcu_Cfg.h

AUTOSAR requires that API functions shall check the validity of their respective parameters.
These checks are for development error reporting and can be enabled or disabled.

##### DEM

By  default,  production  code  related  errors  are  reported  to  the  DEM  using  the  service DEM_ReportErrorStatus().

**Note:** Dem Event is enable only if `$(Module_Name)DemEventParameterRefs` is enabled.

##### Callback Notification

There are no Callback Notifications.

##### SchM

If multiple AUTOSAR runnables have access to the same Data Store Memory block, the exported AUTOSAR specification enforces data consistency by using an AUTOSAR exclusive area. With this specification, the runnables have mutually exclusive access to the per-instance memory global data, which prevents data corruption. Beside the OS, the BSW Scheduler provides functions that MCU module calls at begin and end of critical sections. This implementation requires 1 level of exclusive access to guard critical sections.

The data consistency mechanism that has to be applied to an ExclusiveArea might be domain, ECU or even project specific. The decision which mechanism has to be applied by RTE / Basic Software Scheduler is taken during ECU integration by setting the Exclusive Area configuration parameter RteExclusiveAreaImplMechanism. This parameter is an input for RTE generator. For MCU Module, data consistency and exclusive access to critical sections are required for the following sections as shown in the table below:

| Exclusive Area Functions used | MCU Function calling Exclusive Area | Need for Exclusive Area | Recommended Exclusive Area Mapping |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|MCU_EXCLUSIVE_AREA_0 | Mcu_PerformReset | To protect against multiple access for shared resources |ALL_INTERRUPT_BLOCKING : All interrupts should be blocked as this API’s can be called in the interrupts |

#### Multi-core support

Not supported

**Note:** McuPllTimeoutDuration parameter Value should be passed as number of ticks according to clock frequency. The clock source have changed from RTI timers which used
200MHz clock frequency to R5f timers which uses 400MHz clock frequency, so the timeout
values need to be configured accordingly.

### Examples

#### Overview

1. Initialize MCU using Mcu_Init() and McuApp_Startup(). MCU module will initialize the clock for configured modules
2. Do the Port and Platform initialization using Port_Init() and McuApp_PlatformInit()
3. McuRamSectionBaseAddress is configured with 'zero' and reference array is also configured with default value of RAM section.
4. Mcu_InitRamSection API is invoked in order to set 'McuRamSectionBaseAddress' with default value.
5. Reference array and McuRamSectionBaseAddress is compared with each other to check whether RAM section is initialized properly or not.
6. It will also check for reset reason.
7. Mcu_GetResetReason API's return value is compared with MCU_POWER_ON_RESET to check the wakeup cause.

#### Hardware Software Setup and Tools

None

#### Steps to build and run example

MCU example application demonstrating the MCAL MCU driver features is in folder *<MCAL_ROOT>/examples/Mcu*.

This application can be built from the root folder by giving *gmake –s mcu_app PLATFORM=am263*.

Once the build is completed we get a binary file, which is loaded in our controller and executed.
