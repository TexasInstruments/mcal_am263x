```

The expected flow for utilization of the driver as per the example application is interrupt registration (only required in case of interrupt mode), I2c driver initialization using Cdd_I2c_Init(). Post initialization buffer set up linking is done to point channels to their respective buffers using Cdd_I2c_SetupEB() and for writing data to slaves Cdd_I2c_AsyncTransmit() is used in both polling as well as interrupt mode.

For reception of data from I2c slaves Cdd_I2c_AsyncTransmit() can be used in interrupt mode. If polling mode is being used, use Cdd_I2c_MainFunction() to process any sequence in the queue and update the status of the queue to real time value.

#### Initialization

The driver I2C is initialized by calling Cdd_I2c_Init(). To re-initialize the driver call Cdd_I2c_DeInit() and then Cdd_I2c_Init() again. Only pre-compile variant is supported for the driver, hence all configuration related parameters are provided through the GUI. The service for de-initialization is provided with the function Cdd_I2c_DeInit().

#### States

I2C maintains states for:

1. Driver

   * CDD_I2C_UNINIT

      * Driver is uninitialized
      * Cdd_I2c_Init() has not been called or Cdd_I2c_DeInit() has been called after initialization

   * CDD_I2C_IDLE

      * Driver is currently free, not in the middle of any transmission/reception process

   * CDD_I2C_BUSY

      * Driver is currently in use, transmission/reception in process

   The state for I2c driver is returned with Cdd_I2c_GetStatus() function call.

2. Channels

   * CDD_I2C_CH_RESULT_OK

      * Channel transmission/reception not yet started
      * Channel transmission/reception successful

   * CDD_I2C_CH_RESULT_NOT_OK

      * Channel transmission/reception is not OK

   * CDD_I2C_CH_RESULT_IN_PROGRESS

      * Channel transmission/reception currently in progress

   * CDD_I2C_CH_RESULT_BUSFAIL

      * Channel transmission/reception failed due to bus fault

   * CDD_I2C_CH_RESULT_ARBFAIL

      * Channel transmission/reception failed due to arbitration loss

   * CDD_I2C_CH_RESULT_NACKFAIL

      * Channel transmission/reception failed due to no acknowledge from target

   The channel status is returned with Cdd_I2c_GetResult() function call.
   In case incorrect channel ID is passed a DET error occur

### Module Requirements

#### Memory Mapping

The objects (e.g. variables, functions, constants) are declared by compiler independent definitions – the compiler abstraction definitions. Each compiler abstraction definition is assigned to a memory section. The following table contains the memory section names and the compiler abstraction definitions of the I2C and illustrates their assignment among each other.

#### Error Handling

##### Development Error Reporting

By default, development errors are reported to the DET using the service Det_ReportError(), if development error reporting is enabled (i.e. precompile parameter   CDD_I2C_DEV_ERROR_DETECT==STD_ON). If another module is used for development error reporting, the function prototype for reporting the error can be configured by the integrator, but must have the same signature as the service Det_ReportError(). The reported I2C ID is 255

### Used Resources

#### Interrupt Handling

Interrupt routines are provided by the CDD I2C driver is Cdd_I2c_Isr_Handler(). Basically, the ISR’s are in the file Cdd_I2c_Irq.c. User might edit it for adapting for the suitable OS.
Interrupt handler shall be provided for each instance of the CDD I2C driver.
The corresponding CDD I2C Interrupt numbers are:

| Hardware Unit| ISR Handler Mapped| Interrupt Number|
|-----|-----|-----|
|0|Cdd_I2c_HwUnit0_ISR|44|
|1|Cdd_I2c_HwUnit1_ISR|45|
|2|Cdd_I2c_HwUnit2_ISR|46|
|3|Cdd_I2c_HwUnit3_ISR|47|

### Integration Description

#### Dependent Modules

##### DET

The module I2C depends on the DET (by default) in order to report development errors. Detection and reporting of development errors can be enabled or disabled by the switch "Enable Development Error Detection" on the "General" container within the module I2C. The DET can be replaced optionally by an equivalent component which is responsible to recognize development errors, if no DET component is available.

##### MCU

The module MCU powers up the microcontroller’s peripherals at startup time and initializes clock source. Since the peripherals are also containing the registers for I/O functionality they have to be activated if it is intended to use them.

##### PORT

The module PORT enables the I2C lines at startup time. To operate the I2C properly, the PORT driver has to be configured. The PORT driver sets the Pins to the required values for the I2C to operate. The Pins used are SDA (serial data line) and SCL (serial clock). An open drain configuration is recommended. Some I2C drivers require the PORT for switching from I2C functionality to DIO functionality – to use the "clock free" procedure - and back.

##### SchM

If multiple AUTOSAR runnables have access to the same Data Store Memory block, the exported AUTOSAR specification enforces data consistency by using an AUTOSAR exclusive area. With this specification, the runnables have mutually exclusive access to the per-instance memory global data, which prevents data corruption. Beside the OS, the BSW Scheduler provides functions that CDD I2C module calls at begin and end of critical sections. This implementation requires 1 level of exclusive access to guard critical sections.

The data consistency mechanism that has to be applied to an ExclusiveArea might be domain, ECU or even project specific. The decision which mechanism has to be applied by RTE / Basic Software Scheduler is taken during ECU integration by setting the Exclusive Area configuration parameter RteExclusiveAreaImplMechanism. This parameter is an input for RTE generator.

For CDD_I2C Module, data consistency and exclusive access to critical sections are required for the following sections as shown in the table below:

| Exclusive Area Functions used | CDD_I2C Function calling Exclusive Area | Need for Exclusive Area | Recommended Exclusive Area Mapping |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|CDD_I2C_EXCLUSIVE_AREA_0 | Cdd_I2c_SetupEB() <br>Cdd_I2c_SetupEBDynamic() <br>Cdd_I2c_AsyncTransmit() <br>Cdd_I2c_Cancel() <br>Cdd_I2c_MainFunction() | To protect against multiple access for shared resources|**ALL_INTERRUPT_BLOCKING** : All interrupts should be blocked as this API's can be called in the interrupts |

##### Configurable Callback Functions

###### Notifications

At its configurable interfaces the I2C defines notifications that can be mapped to callback functions in case completion of a sequence or failure of a sequence. The mapping is not statically defined by the I2C but can be performed at configuration time.

###### Cdd_I2c_SequenceEndNotification

Sequence transfer successful notification function. Can be configured in the configuration tool.
Particularities and Limitations: It is advised to keep the code execution in the notification function as short as possible.
Call context: Interrupt as well as polling

###### Cdd_I2c_SequenceErrorNotification

Sequence transfer error notification function. If the I2c detects an error, this function notifies the application about a communication failure. Can be configured in the configuration tool.
Particularities and Limitations: It is advised to keep the code execution in the notification function as short as possible.
Call context: Interrupt as well as polling

For the Following API’s it is possible to be called from the sequence notifications:

   1. Cdd_I2c_GetVersionInfo
   2. Cdd_I2c_SetupEB
   3. Cdd_I2c_SetupEBDynamic
   4. Cdd_I2c_GetResult
   5. Cdd_I2c_GetSequenceResult
   6. Cdd_I2c_GetStatus

### Examples

The example applications demonstrates use of I2C module, the list below identifies key steps performed in the example.

#### Overview

* I2c Example:
  * Initialize clock using Mcu_Init()
  * Initializes pins as I2C SDA and SCL using Port_Init()
  * Get I2C version using Cdd_I2c_GetVersionInfo()
  * Initialize I2c module using Cdd_I2c_Init()
  * Set up channels using Cdd_I2c_SetupEBDynamic()
  * Write data to target device
  * Receive and process data
  * De-initialize I2c module using Cdd_I2c_DeInit()

#### Setup Required to Run Example

* Install Code Composer Studio(CCS) latest version
* Install latest C29 compiler
* Connect the hardware and power up
* Connect the uart and set up the baudrate to check the log on serial console

#### How to Run Examples

I2C example application demonstrating the MCAL I2C driver features is in folder <MCAL_ROOT>/examples/I2c.
This application can be built from the root folder by giving "gmake -s i2c_app PLATFORM=am263".
