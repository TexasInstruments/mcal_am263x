## Structure Members

|  Member Type   | Member name    | Brief |
| -------------- | -------------- | ----- |
|  uint8 | Dir |  This element indicates whether we read from or write to the slave, initially assigned some random value updated during Cdd_I2c_SetupEB function call.  |
|  [Cdd_I2c_AddressType](../Modules/group___c_d_d___i2_c.md#typedef-cdd_i2c_addresstype) | SlaveAddress |  This element contains the address of the slave, user configurable.  |
|  uint8 | SlaveAddressScheme |  If this element is 0, the slave has a 7 bit address and a 10 bit address if this element is 1, user configurable.  |
|  [Cdd_I2c_DataLengthType](../Modules/group___c_d_d___i2_c.md#typedef-cdd_i2c_datalengthtype) | DataBufferLength |  This element contains the size of the data buffer, initially 0 will be updated after Cdd_I2c_SetupEB function call.  |
|  [Cdd_I2c_DataPtrType](../Modules/group___c_d_d___i2_c.md#typedef-cdd_i2c_dataptrtype) | DataBuffer |  This element contains a pointer to which initially points to NULL but will be updated after Cdd_I2c_SetupEB function call.  |
|  [Cdd_I2c_ChannelResultType](../Modules/group___c_d_d___i2_c.md#enum-cdd_i2c_channelresulttype) | ChannelResult |  This element contains the channel result.  |
