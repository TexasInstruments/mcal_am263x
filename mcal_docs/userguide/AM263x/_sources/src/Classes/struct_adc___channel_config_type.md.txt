title: Adc_ChannelConfigType
summary: Structure containing parameters for ADC MCAL channel configuration. In term of ADC hardware, this represents the step configuration. There are ADC_NUM_CHANNEL steps in the ADC hardware and each step could be mapped to an actual hardware input channel.

## Structure Members

|  Member Type   | Member name    | Brief |
| -------------- | -------------- | ----- |
|  uint32 | hwChannelId |  The hardware channel number from which input is given. Valid values: ADC_MIN_HW_CHANNEL_ID to ADC_MAX_HW_CHANNEL_ID 0x0 = Channel 1 0x1 = Channel 2 0x2 = Channel 3 0x3 = Channel 4 0x4 = Channel 5.  |
|  uint32 | samplewindow |  The sampleWindow parameter is the acquisition window duration in SYSCLK cycles. It should be a value between 1 and 512 cycles inclusive. The selected duration must be at least as long as one ADCCLK cycle. Also, the datasheet will specify a minimum window duration requirement in nanoseconds.  |
|  boolean | channelEnableLimitCheck |  The channel is enabled for limit check.  |
|  uint32 | highRange |  Sampled ADC data is compared to this value. If the sampled data is greater than this value, then interrupt is generated. Valid values: ADC_MIN_RANGE to ADC_MAX_RANGE.  |
|  uint32 | lowRange |  Sampled ADC data is compared to this value. If the sampled data is lesser than this value, then interrupt is generated. Valid values: ADC_MIN_RANGE to ADC_MAX_RANGE.  |
