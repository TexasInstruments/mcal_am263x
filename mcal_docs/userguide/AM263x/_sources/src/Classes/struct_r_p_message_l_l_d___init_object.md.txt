## Detailed Description

```cpp
struct RPMessageLLD_InitObject;
```


**Brief**: 
IPC RPMessage driver initialization object. 

**Note**: 

  * Set vringTxBaseAddr[], vringTxBaseAddr[] to RPMESSAGE_VRING_ADDR_INVALID for cores that are not needed for IPC RPMessage. 
  * All cores MUST set the same value for `vringSize`, `vringNumBuf`, `vringMsgSize`. 
  * Set `vringTxBaseAddr`, `vringRxBaseAddr`, based on source and destination cores. 
  * VRING memory is shared across all cores AND this memory MUST be marked as non-cached at all the cores.
