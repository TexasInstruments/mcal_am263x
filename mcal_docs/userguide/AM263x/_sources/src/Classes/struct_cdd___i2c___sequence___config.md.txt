This is a structure for CDD_I2C sequence which serves as the primary unit for I2C communication in this driver. 


`#include <Cdd_I2c.h>`

## Structure Members

|  Member Type   | Member name    | Brief |
| -------------- | -------------- | ----- |
|  uint8 | HwInstance |  This element points to which I2C hardware instance to use for communication with slave, user configurable.  |
|  uint32 | MaxChannels |  This element indicates the maximum number of channels in the given sequence, user configurable.  |
|  [Cdd_I2c_SeqResultType](../Modules/group___c_d_d___i2_c.md#enum-cdd_i2c_seqresulttype) | SeqResult |  This element contains the sequence result.  |
|  [Cdd_I2c_SequenceEndNotification](../Modules/group___c_d_d___i2_c.md#typedef-cdd_i2c_sequenceendnotification) | SequenceCompleteNotify |  This element is a function pointer which points to the address of user provided API, in case of successful sequence completion.  |
|  [Cdd_I2c_SequenceErrorNotification](../Modules/group___c_d_d___i2_c.md#typedef-cdd_i2c_sequenceerrornotification) | SequenceErrorNotify |  This element is a function pointer which points to the address of user provided API, in case of unsuccessful sequence completion.  |
|  [Cdd_I2c_SequenceType](../Modules/group___c_d_d___i2_c.md#typedef-cdd_i2c_sequencetype)[CDD_I2C_MAXIMUM_CHANNEL_NUMBER] | ChannelList |  This element indicates the channel numbers used by a sequence.  |
|  [Cdd_I2c_RestartModeType](../Modules/group___c_d_d___i2_c.md#enum-cdd_i2c_restartmodetype) | RestartMode |  This element indicates the transmission mode for the slave.  |
