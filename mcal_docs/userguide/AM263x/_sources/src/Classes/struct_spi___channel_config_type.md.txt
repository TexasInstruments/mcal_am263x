SPI Channel configuration structure. 


`#include <Spi_Cfg.h>`

## Structure Members

|  Member Type   | Member name    | Brief |
| -------------- | -------------- | ----- |
|  Spi_ChannelType | channelId |  Channel ID.  |
|  uint8 | channelBufType |  Buffer Type IB/EB.  |
|  uint8 | dataWidth |  Width of clock frame in bits. In case of McSPI, valid values are from 1 to 32 bits.  |
|  uint32 | defaultTxData |  Default transmit value when TX buffer is NULL_PTR.  |
|  Spi_NumberOfDataType | maxBufLength |  Max data length for external or internal buffer in SPI words. In case of internal buffers, this represents the number of words to copy from application buffer to internal buffer in case of Spi_WriteIB() API or from internal buffer to application buffer in case of Spi_ReadIB(). The value of this should be less than or equal to the SPI configuration SPI_IB_MAX_LENGTH as this macro is is used for buffer allocation.  |
|  [Spi_TransferType](../Modules/group___s_p_i.md#enum-spi_transfertype) | transferType |  Start with MSB or LSB. Only MSB is supported.  |
