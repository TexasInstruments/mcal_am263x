### Functional Overview

The EthTrcv module initializes and controls the Ethernet transceivers (commonly called as Ethernet PHYs).
It provides services to configure all PHYs present on board to enable transfer of Ethernet frames. It uses MII APIs of Eth driver.

#### Driver Architecture

The following figure shows where the EthTrcv is located in the AUTOSAR architecture.

#### Initialization

EthTrcv_Init called to initialize the EthTrcv driver at power on, and on this the driver state will change to ETHTRCV_STATE_INIT.

The initialization covers the following steps

1. Reset transceiver.
2. Check link status and if link is up, configuring all transceiver configuration parameters (e.g., baud rate, duplex mode, automatic negotiation).
3. Set loopback mode, if enabled in configuration.

#### States

The states and modes of the EthTrcv driver define whether the EthTrcv driver is operational or not.
There are two states in which the Ethernet hardware/driver can be in.

1. ETHTRCV_STATE_UNINIT: This is the state when the Driver is not yet configured.
2. ETHTRCV_STATE_INIT: This is the state when the Driver is configured and initialization was successful.

#### ETHTRCV modes

There are 2 modes in which the EthTrcv driver can be in.

1. ETHTRCV_MODE_DOWN: This mode can be set by the EthTrcv_SetTransceiverMode to disable the EthTrcv.
2. ETHTRCV_MODE_ACTIVE: This is the state in which the hardware is initialized and is running.

The states and modes coexist. The modes of the driver can be changed by the API EthTrcv_SetTransceiverMode.

#### Auto-negotiation

In Auto negotiation **Ethernet controller** and **Transceiver** (PHY) choose common transmission parameters, such as speed, duplex mode, and flow control. They first share their capabilities regarding these parameters and then choose the highest performance transmission mode they both support.

EthTrcv driver initiates auto-negotiation process. Also, separate API EthTrcv_StartAutoNegotiation can be used. The parameters used for auto-negotiation are passed during initialization through structure EthTrcv Config.

#### Assumptions

The Ethernet BSW stack is intended to be used wherever high data rates are required but no hard real-time is required. Of course, it can also be used for less-demanding use cases, i.e. for low data rates.

#### Limitations

The Ethernet Transceiver Driver module is only able to handle a single thread of execution. The execution must not be pre-empted by itself.

#### Design overview

Will be updated in next release

#### Memory Mapping

The objects (e.g., variables, functions, constants) are declared by compiler independent definitions – the compiler abstraction definitions. Each compiler abstraction definition is assigned to a memory section.

The following table contains the memory section names and the compiler abstraction definitions defined for the EthTrcv and illustrate their assignment among each other.

### Integration description

#### Dependent modules

##### Eth Driver

EthTrcv driver depends on Ethernet Controller Driver (Eth) for transceiver access via Media Independent Interface (MII). Eth APIs Eth_ReadMII and Eth_WriteMII are used by EthTrcv for accessing transceiver registers.

##### MCU

The module MCU powers up the microcontroller peripherals at startup time and initializes the PLL and the internal clock domains which go to the Ethernet controller. No specific initialization needed for transceiver.

##### PORT

No specific port configuration is needed for EthTrcv driver, though to access transceiver registers we need port configuration which is done as a part of Eth driver port configuration.

##### AUTOSAR OS (Optional)

An operating system can be used for task scheduling, interrupt handling, global suspend and restore of interrupts and creating of the Interrupt Vector Table. The EthTrcv module may use OSEK/AUTOSAR OS to suspend and restore global interrupts.

##### DET

The module EthTrcv depends on the DET (by default) to report development errors. Detection and reporting of development errors can be enabled or disabled by the switch "Enable Development Error Detection" on the tab "General Settings" within the module EthTrcv.

The DET can be replaced optionally by an equivalent component which is responsible to recognize development errors, if no DET component is available.

##### DEM

By default, production code related errors are reported to the DEM using the service Dem_SetEventStatus().

##### Callback Notification

EthTrcv have two Callback Notifications:

1. EthTrcv_ReadMiiIndication : Called when information has been read out via MII interface. Triggered by previous Eth_ReadMii call. EthTrcv_ReadMiiIndication can directly be called within Eth_ReadMii.
2. EthTrcv_WriteMiiIndication : Called when information has been written via MII interface. Triggered by previous Eth_WriteMii call. EthTrcv_WriteMiiIndication can directly be called within Eth_WriteMii.

##### SchM

If multiple AUTOSAR runnables have access to the same Data Store Memory block, the exported AUTOSAR specification enforces data consistency by using an AUTOSAR exclusive area. With this specification, the runnables have mutually exclusive access to the per-instance memory global data, which prevents data corruption. Beside the OS, the BSW Scheduler provides functions that ETH TRCV module calls at begin and end of critical sections. This implementation requires 1 level of exclusive access to guard critical sections.

The data consistency mechanism that has to be applied to an ExclusiveArea might be domain, ECU or even project specific. The decision which mechanism has to be applied by RTE / Basic Software Scheduler is taken during ECU integration by setting the Exclusive Area configuration parameter RteExclusiveAreaImplMechanism. This parameter is an input for RTE generator. For ETH TRCV Module, data consistency and exclusive access to critical sections are required for the following sections as shown in the table below:

| Exclusive Area Functions used | ETH TRCV Function calling Exclusive Area | Need for Exclusive Area | Recommended Exclusive Area Mapping |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|Will be updated in future release |  |  | |
