 *      Project:  TI Sitara MCU AM263x PwmDriver
 *       Module:  DriverPwm
 *    Generator:  EB Tresos
 *
 *  Description:  This component provides services for initialization and control of the microcontroller internal
 *                PWM unit (pulse width modulation). The PWM module generates pulses with variable pulse width.
 *                It allows the selection of the duty cycle and the signal period time.
